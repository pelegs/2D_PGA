## Simple 2D Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) "engine"

### What?
Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) is amazing. [No, really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i3ocLhbxJ4). It allows you to do all of the operations you would ever want in a geomtery - but in a simplified manner. You want to find the point where two lines meet? The line where two planes meet? It's the same operation! (*spoiler*: the wedge/external product)

You want to find the line connecting to points? The plane spanned by a point and a line? Again - same operation (*spoiler*: this time its their "join", expressed via the regressive product). Projections, rotations and translation are all similarly simple and unified.

### Ok, but what's this repo?

This is just an extremely simple engine written in python for quick development.

### Why?
I want to use 3D PGA to write a simple 3D engine in C/C++ (or even CUDA!). However, I'm not convinced I understand it fully. Therefore, I want to first explore it and experiment with. What's better for that than python (and numpy)?

### Do you have some more information?
You should head over to [bivector.net](https://bivector.net/) for all the information you'll ever need about Geomteric Algebra.

...ok, not all ALL, but a very good amount.
